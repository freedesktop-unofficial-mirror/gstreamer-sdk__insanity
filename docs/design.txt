GStreamer QA system
-------------------

Split-up
--------

  Most of the code will be in the qagst python module (and
  sub-modules), along with the default implementations of monitors and
  tests.

  The executables (clients, master, etc...) will be as lightweight as
  possible.

  Apart from the default implementation of tests,monitors,... ALL
  other tests should not be in the qagst python module.

Modules
-------

* monitor.py
* test.py
* environment.py
* storage.py
* generator.py
* type.py ???
