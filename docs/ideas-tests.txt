Ideas for tests and monitors
----------------------------

Here will be a list of ideas for new tests and monitors that could be
written for the QA system.

TESTS
-----

Encoder/Muxer testing
 Goal : Test the various combinations of encoders and muxers
 3 step : * Encode Xs of data
          * Typefind resulting file
          * compare results to see if the decoded file is identical

Seeking tests
 Goal : Test various seeking types
   How long does it take for the seek to happen
   How much data is needed

Various tests on broken/incomplete files
 Goal : test how solid we are
   This is interesting in the case where you're partly through
 downloading a file, either with http/ftp or with p2p-like systems
 (edonkey, bt,...)
   Something interesting would be the ability to skip over
 non-downloaded parts for example.

Tagging tests
  Goal : Check we can read all tags present in a file
    We could check the results using some external tag-reading software

  Goal : Make sure what tags the various muxers can accept

MONITORS
--------
 monitor bitrate usage at each pad
 monitor queue levels
 monitor QOS
 monitor latency in live pipelines
