GStreamer QA system

TODO

Milestone 1
-----------
Goal : Compatible behaviour as gst-media-test, but using the new API.

* bin/gst-media-test
 * document the usage

* testrun
 * Add possibility to modify the environment

* Monitor support
 * gdb/backtrace monitor

* Reporting support

Milestone 2
-----------
Goal : Database support

* DB storage support
 * Store monitors
* Remote DB storage support
 * Might have to be done with Milestone 3+4

Milestone 3
-----------
Goal : Centralized scheduling/control system

Using buildbot

Milestone 4
-----------
Goal : Search/Query/Reporting centralized system


Non-milestone-specific / Bonus features
---------------------------------------
* Speed optimizations
 * DBusRemoteTest : Add features so that, for some tests, we don't spawn a new
   remote process for every instance, but instead reuse existing ones (and
   re-spawning new instances if that one crashes).
 * Storage : SQLite storage is being done in the main thread, which can take
   several seconds... blocking the triggering of other subtests.
 * Storage : SQLite backend shouldn't always execute/commit for every single
   command, but rather do many executes and then one commit, or use
   executemany

* Namespace changing
 * Switch to instanity (Insanity / net.gstreamer.Insanity)

* Smarter introspection
 * Make __test_arguments__ have more information :
  * default value
  * full documentation on that argument
 * Make __test_checklist__ have more information :
  * full documentation , especially explaining what could have caused
    that step to not be validated, to make debugging/fixing easier.

* Ordered list of tuples instead of dictionnaries of tuples
 * Maybe this could also apply to other properties

* Database
 * Make sure we use cPickle only for generic (non-gstqa-specific) objects
 * Add convenience functions for merging two DB together (or one in another).
 * Store the test class as an integer and not a name
 * Add methods for updating old-versioned DB

* Tests
 * Add some form of versioning so we can track changes.
  * Maybe upgrade version based on variations of arguments/checklist/extrainfo/behaviour

* DBUS
 * Fix issue in a 'asv' when one of the values is a list, we currently avoid this
   by removing all values of type 'list'
