Non-milestone-specific / Bonus features
---------------------------------------
* Speed optimizations
 * DBusRemoteTest : Add features so that, for some tests, we don't spawn a new
   remote process for every instance, but instead reuse existing ones (and
   re-spawning new instances if that one crashes).

* Namespace changing
 * Switch to instanity (Insanity / net.gstreamer.Insanity)
